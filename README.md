# Doc-JIT

 *Just In Time* documentation.

## Introduction

Display the right documentation when you need it. Doc-JIT is an VS Code extension developers to open the most relevant documentation when coding features. It is based on your architecture when you can define which documentation is relevant for a specific file path.

## Getting started

1. Create a `.doc-jit` directory next to `src`,
2. write your documentation based on your architecture,
3. use wildcards `__` when folders have specific names (eg: `modules/__/components/component.md` works for `modules/user/component/` or `modules/book/component/`)
